He projects that in 1543,commissioned by Biagio Saraceno and his brother Giacomo, with the scope to be for them the center of their agrarian property. \r\n\r\nThe works end in 1555, and this building remains property of this family until 1604. In this year, Euremma Saraceno married Scipione Caldogno,and this family owns that until 1838. \r\n\r\nAfter a large number of changes in ownerships, in 1989 Villa Saraceno became the head office of the foundation \"The Landmark Trust\", that restores it in 1994. From 1996, it's one of the UNESCO's heritage.\r\n\r\n![Front side of Villa Saraceno's main house](https://github.com/cvdlab-cg/404701/blob/master/final-project/material/pictures/VillaSaraceno_front1.jpg?raw=true)\r\n\r\n### The architecture of Villa Saraceno\r\nThis villa has a very simple plant. The main house, as the other two dependance placed near the main complex,has a rectangular form. \r\n\r\nIt presents two steps, one in the front side and one in the back side of the main house. There are two colonnades; firstable, at the entrance of the Villa,composed by four square columns, and another one is placed in front of the first dependance. In this case, the column are rounded, and higher than the others.These parts are the most important and complex elements of the villa. \r\n\r\n![Villa Saraceno 2](https://github.com/cvdlab-cg/404701/blob/master/final-project/material/pictures/VillaSaraceno_front3.jpg?raw=true)\r\n\r\nThere are many windows, placed in every of the three level of the villa. Some of these presents brown cornices (in particular, the windows of the main house), the rest of the group has only the glass. \r\n\r\nIn the back side, the entrance is represented by a central door; there is an other entrance,still in the back, in the link between first and second dependance,while in the front side there are other five doors after the lateral colonnade.\r\n\r\nFinally, the villa presents roofs with triangular surfaces in every parts of the building. Above these, there are some chimneys, that in total are four. \r\n\r\nThe plant below represents the current form of the villa, that in the past had carried out a large number of restores.\r\n\r\n![Map of Villa Saraceno](https://github.com/cvdlab-cg/404701/blob/master/final-project/material/pictures/VillaSaraceno_map.jpg?raw=true)\r\n\r\n### The work organization\r\n\r\nThe difficult part of this work has been probably the very large number of protrusions of the villa's walls. It doesn't present many curves, only the lateral colonnade is composed by rounded body for every column, and in the entrance the links between the the square columns are by arcs. \r\n\r\nI follow this compositional organization of work:\r\n\r\n**1) MAIN HOUSE:** the most important part of the villa,the center of the property.\r\n\r\n**2) FIRST DEPENDANCE:** it starts immediately after the main house ends, and it ends with the lateral colonnade.\r\n\r\n**3) SECOND DEPENDANCE:** the rest part.\r\n\r\nBut every one of this is divide in other parts, that are **Front side, Back side and Lateral sides**.Obviously, i decide to draw the plant of the villa before starting to build it, to be sure that the lines and the forms were right.\r\n\r\nAfter this, in order of importance, i drew:\r\n\r\n**1)  WINDOWS**: in every part of the villa, following the order \"Top, Low, Intermediate\".\r\n\r\n**2)  DOORS**: one in the central house, many others in the two dependances.\r\n\r\n**3)  CORNICE**: only for the most important windows (placed in the main house).\r\n\r\n**4)  INTERIOR WALLS**: following the plant of the villa .\r\n\r\n**5)  ROOFS**: important for the strange form and details they have.\r\n\r\n**6)  CHIMNEYS,ALLYWAY AND LAWN**: last, but not least!Made as could be decorative and functional at the same time.\r\n\r\nThere are some examples:\r\n![Window](https://github.com/cvdlab-cg/404701/blob/master/final-project/material/pictures/snapshot9.jpg?raw=true)\r\n![Chimney](https://github.com/cvdlab-cg/404701/blob/master/final-project/material/pictures/snapshot8.jpg?raw=true)\r\n![Roof](https://github.com/cvdlab-cg/404701/blob/master/final-project/material/pictures/snapshot7.jpg?raw=true)\r\n\r\n\r\nHow i wrote before, the most difficult and important things are represented by the two steps and the colonnade. In particular, for the two colonnade, i had to divide every column in:\r\n\r\n**1) LOW CAPITAL AND TOP CAPITAL**: round in some part, square in some other.\r\n\r\n**2) BODY OF COLUMN**: as above.\r\n\r\nExample of columns:\r\n![columns](https://github.com/cvdlab-cg/404701/blob/master/final-project/material/pictures/snapshot12.jpg?raw=true)\r\n\r\nFor drawing the forms, i used in particular these function:\r\n\r\n_1)SIMPLEX_GRID:_ useful for walls and regular surfaces.\r\n\r\n_2)BEZIER :_ useful for curves, but also for irregular forms with lines or curves.\r\n\r\n_3)CUBIC_HERMITE:_ useful for curves, arcs, composing with BEZIER function to draw surfaces and solids.\r\n\r\nOther auxiliary function used are:\r\n\r\n**1) TRANSLATE**: cause some pieces have to be placed in the right part.\r\n\r\n**2) ROTATE**: to reuse other pieces (i.e: in the main roof, to put oblique the squares under the roof).\r\n\r\n### Final results\r\nAt the end, the results obtained are quite good, and they are represented by this images:\r\n\r\nFront Facade\r\n![saraceno](https://github.com/cvdlab-cg/404701/blob/master/final-project/material/pictures/VillaSaraceno_front2.jpg?raw=true)\r\n![saracenoSnap1](https://github.com/cvdlab-cg/404701/blob/master/final-project/material/pictures/snapshot1.jpg?raw=true)\r\n\r\nBack Facade\r\n![back](https://github.com/cvdlab-cg/404701/blob/master/final-project/material/pictures/VillaSaraceno_back1.jpg?raw=true)\r\n![backSNAP](https://github.com/cvdlab-cg/404701/blob/master/final-project/material/pictures/snapshot6.jpg?raw=true)\r\n\r\nOther Images:\r\n![front](https://github.com/cvdlab-cg/404701/blob/master/final-project/material/pictures/VillaSaraceno_front4.jpg?raw=true)\r\n![frontSNAP](https://github.com/cvdlab-cg/404701/blob/master/final-project/material/pictures/snapshot2.jpg?raw=true)\r\n![RETRO](https://github.com/cvdlab-cg/404701/blob/master/final-project/material/pictures/VillaSaraceno_back2.jpg?raw=true)\r\n![RETRO2](https://github.com/cvdlab-cg/404701/blob/master/final-project/material/pictures/snapshot3.jpg?raw=true)\r\n\r\nThanks for the attention!\r\n\r\n**_Gianluca Di Vilio._**\r\n\r\nPS: thanks [www.villevenete.net](http://www.villevenete.net/) for the images!","name":"Villa-Saraceno-webpage","google":"","tagline":"A  description about my work on the 3D model of Villa Saraceno"}
